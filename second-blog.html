                  <h1>What Does it Take to Become a Great Software Engineer?</h1>
               </div>
               <h5 class="blog-heading">Knowledge of the full stack</h5>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  While everybody has a different definition of what being a "full stack" Software Engineer means, in a nutshell, it is the capacity to understand every layer of a software product.
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  The term "Full Stack" often refers to multiple technologies and parts: frontend, backend, database, web server, hardware, and network. Just like a good Mechanician needs to understand how an engine works to fix or improve a part of it, a Software Engineer must have an understanding of all the layers to be able to properly contribute to the system. Obviously, no one can be an expert in all areas, but any great Software Engineer will have the basic foundations.               
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  this knowledge can be disastrous. While I was working as a Software Engineer at LinkedIn, a recent graduate who was a "frontend specialist" implemented a feature that was querying a field in the user database table. Because the table was not properly configured to handle this query, both the database and the website went down for 20 minutes, which had a huge impact on the business. This would not have happened if this Software Engineer had been full-stack developer - that is, if he had a minimum of database knowledge and not just frontend knowledge.               
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  A good place to start is to ensure you are comfortable with:               
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Algorithm and data structure</li>
                  <li>Application development with oriented object programming language</li>
                  <li>System administration and networking</li>
               </ul>
               <h5 class="blog-heading">The ability to to learn by yourself</h5>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  Core software concepts remain about the same, but the tools used in the industry are constantly changing. These new tools allow developers to build better, faster and more reliable systems. The Software industry is probably one of the fastest changing industries. That is why your smartphone and favorite applications are constantly improving.
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  In this context, highly skilled Software Engineers, who are are responsible for this evolution, need to assess and perhaps learn new tools that will help them to make their applications faster, better and more reliable. Obviously, they are not going back to universities or coding bootcamps to learn these new tools. The best software engineers are able stay up-to date with the latest trends on their own. To do this, you need the fundamental software knowledge and the ability to teach yourself new skills.               
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  New developers often underestimate skills like communication and time management, but they are actually a big part of a great Software Engineer's success. If you decide to create your startup, you will need to convince investors, customers, and people to join your team. If you are an individual contributor, you will need to collaborate with your co-workers, mentors, juniors, and newcomers.               
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  Most great software developers are also experts at the following:               
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Communication</li>
                  <li>verbal: public speaking, presentation…</li>
                  <li>written: documentation, email, post mortem, technical writing…</li>
                  <li>Collaboration</li>
                  <li>Helping co-workers</li>
                  <li>Onboarding newcomers</li>
                  <li>Knowing how and when to ask questions</li>
                  <li>Team spirit</li>
                  <li>Understanding other coworkers</li>
                  <li>Fostering collaboration with other teams (if in large company)</li>
               </ul>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  Remember that for any company, if you do your job well, you are a 1X. But if you are also helping 10 of your co-workers to do their jobs better, then you become an 11X - the type of person successful companies need. A team can only go as fast as the weakest link and successful companies are the fruits of successful teams.			   
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  If you can manage these three skills, you will be an amazing Software Engineer who will easily find a job, and you will be on the path to a promising career. I am so convinced by this that I actually left my Software Engineer job at LinkedIn to start a school that focuses on teaching those skills, and it's called Holberton. All our students are trained on these three main skills.			   
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  In a nutshell, Holberton offers a two-year program that trains highly-skilled Software Engineers. Our application process is open to anyone over 18 and our students go from being teachers, musicians, cashiers, cameramen... To Software Engineers at top Silicon Valley companies like Dropbox, NASA, Docker, Apple, LinkedIn…               
               </p>
               <p  class="content text-justify">
                  Thanks for reading!
